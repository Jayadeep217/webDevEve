Title: Building a Basic Express.js Application with Middleware and Routing

Problem Description:

You are tasked with creating a basic Express.js application. The application should perform the following operations:

Set up an Express.js application.
Define two routes: a GET route at the path "/" and a POST route at the path "/data".
The GET route should respond with a JSON object containing a message: { "message": "Welcome to our API!" }.
The POST route should accept JSON data in the format { "name": "John Doe" } and respond with a JSON object containing a message: { "message": "Hello, John Doe!" }.
Implement a middleware function that logs the request method and the request path for each incoming request.
Code Stub:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Your code goes here

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000');
});
Solution:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Request method: ${req.method}, Request path: ${req.path}`);
    next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Welcome to our API!' });
});

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
    const name = req.body.name;
    res.json({ message: `Hello, ${name}!` });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000');
});
Note: This solution assumes that the 'express' module is installed in your project. If not, you can install it using npm install express.
